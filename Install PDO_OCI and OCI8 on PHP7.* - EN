Install PHP7 and Apache with the following modules:

    OpenSSL PHP Extension
    PDO PHP Extension
    Mbstring PHP Extension
    Tokenizer PHP Extension
    XML PHP Extension

Make sure everything is working

Install "sudo apt-get install libaio1 libaio-dev"

Download the PHP7.1.* package from the Official Site and decompress it into the user's home.

Make sure that the instantclient is version 11.2 or higher and is configured correctly. Check the correct version for your OS. (Ex: Linux x86-64)

NOTE: It must be version 11.2 or higher of the instantclient



Run the commands:
cd ~ /php/ext/pdo_oci

phpize
./configure --with-pdo-oci=instantclient,/opt/oracle/instantclient,11.2 (check version)
make clean
make
make test
sudo make install

Run the commands:
cd ~/php/ext/oci8

Phpize
./configure --with-oci8=shared,instantclient,/opt/oracle/instantclient,11.2 (check version)
make clean
make
make test
sudo make install

Observe in phpinfo() the following data:
Loaded Configuration File /etc/php/7.*/apache2/php.ini
Scan this dir for additional .ini files /etc/php/7.*/apache2/conf.d

When making sure the system PATH, add the following lines to the end of php.ini
extension=oci8.so
extension=pdo_oci.so

Log in to /etc/php/7.*/mods_available
Within this directory, create the following files:
pdo_oci.ini and put the following into it: extension=pdo_oci.so
oci8.ini and within it put the following: extension=oci8.so

And finally access /etc/php/7.*/apache2/conf.d/
Within the directory, create two links with the command:
ln -s /etc/php/7.*/mods-available/pdo_oci.ini 10-pdo_oci.ini
ln -s /etc/php/7.*/mods-available/oci8.ini 10-oci8.ini

Finally, restart Apache2
sudo service apache2 restart

Verify with the command:
php -m
